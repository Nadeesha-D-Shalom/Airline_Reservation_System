# ✈️ Version 1.9.2 — Backend Refactor & Frontend Integration Support

## ⚙️ Backend Enhancements
- Fully refactored backend for **Passenger → Summary → Payment** flow.
- Fixed all **entity relationships** (Booking, Ticket, Passenger, Flight).
- Updated **Spring Boot + SQL Server integration** for Hibernate schema sync.
- Implemented `BookingController`, `BookingService`, and `Passenger` model aligned with frontend.
- Added `BookingRequest` DTO for structured payloads.
- Fixed compilation errors and schema migration warnings.
- Updated `Account`, `Admin`, and `SecurityConfig` for stable **JWT authentication**.
- Cleaned up repository layer (`existsByEmail`, `findByEmail` in `AccountRepository`).

## 💻 Frontend Integration
Backend endpoints verified and ready for:
- `/api/passengers` → `PassengerInfoPage.jsx`
- `/api/bookings` → `BookingSummaryPage.jsx`
- `/api/payments` → `PaymentPage.jsx`

Consistent JSON structures between **React UI** and **Spring Boot** backend achieved.

## 🧩 Highlights
This version made the backend **fully functional and deploy-ready**, ensuring stable data flow across booking, passenger, and payment modules.
